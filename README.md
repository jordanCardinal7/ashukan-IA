High-Level Conceptualization

Step 1: Pre-processing the Data

Objective: Reduce the number of tokens in the raw data to ensure compatibility with GPT-4's token limits.

Tasks:
- Read the RAW_DATA from compiled_data.json.
- Process the data to minimize token usage, which might involve summarizing or extracting key phrases.
- Export the pre-processed data to PRE-PROCESSED_DATA.json.

Step 2: Interaction with GPT-4

Objective: Process the pre-processed data using GPT-4 to generate insights.

Tasks:
- Check if PRE-PROCESSED_DATA.json exceeds the maximum token limit of GPT-4.
- If it exceeds, implement a function to divide the data into manageable chunks.
- For each chunk or the whole data (if within limits), create a GPT-4 API call with the specified prompt.
- Ensure the prompt structure leverages GPT-4's capabilities effectively.
- Collect and store the output from GPT-4 in PROCESSED_DATA.json.

Step 3: Further Processing

Objective: Perform additional processing on the data obtained from GPT-4.

Tasks:
- Define the nature of further processing needed for PROCESSED_DATA.json.
- Implement the processing logic.
- Store or output the final processed data as required.
